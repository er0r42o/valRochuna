# A Little Valentine — For Leila 💌

A small, cute GitHub Pages-ready site to propose to Leila from Fahim. Built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so it's easy to customize.

## What is included
- `index.html` — the page
- `css/styles.css` — styles (pastel pink & violet)
- `js/script.js` — interactivity (cards, modal, confetti, simple generated music)

## Customize
Edit `js/script.js` at the top to change the `NAME_TO` and `NAME_FROM` constants.

To add your own music file, place an MP3 at `assets/music.mp3` and modify `script.js` to play it instead of the generated melody.

## Deploy
1. Init git in this folder: `git init && git add . && git commit -m "Initial valentine"` 🔧
2. Create a GitHub repo (public or private) and push the branch.
3. Enable GitHub Pages in the repo settings (select `main` or `gh-pages` branch). Your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>` ✨

If you'd like, I can initialize the repo, push it, and enable Pages for you — say the word and I can walk through it or do it for you.
